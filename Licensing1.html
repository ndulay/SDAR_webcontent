    <strong>How First Tuesday Licensing Courses Work: </strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Order your courses. </strong>All First Tuesday courses are homestudy courses. We deliver the materials in print, online and on CD-ROM (the books for courses marked with a &quot;^&quot; are only available in print). Online access is immediate; mailed items ship the business day after the order is placed and arrive within 5-7 business days. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Study your materials.</strong> The state-mandated minimum study time is 18 days per course. The maximum study time is one year from the date of your order. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. (Optional) Take the quizzes.</strong> Optional quizzes are provided with all First Tuesday licensing courses. Answers are provided to help you measure your understanding of the material. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>4. Pass your course exams.</strong> The open-book course exams can be taken online or through the mail. Each course exam is 100 multiple choice questions over 2 hours and 30 minutes. The passing score for each course exam is 60%. You may take your course exams as many times as you need to pass within your one-year enrollment period. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>5. Obtain your Certificates of Completion.</strong> Once you pass your course exams, you may print your own Certificates of Completion online. We will also mail you copies. The Certificate of Completion for each course must accompany your application for the State Exam. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>6. (Optional) Study the State Exam Prep Book.</strong> Prepare for the State Exam by reviewing a pool of sample questions representing topics commonly covered in the State Exam. <br />
