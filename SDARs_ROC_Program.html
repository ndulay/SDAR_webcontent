  <div class="content-box two"> The SDAR Government Affairs Committee developed the REALTOR&reg; Office Contact (ROC)  program as a grassroots political education and mobilization program to inform each office of  government affairs impacting the real estate industry.  <br />
    <br />
    <strong>What is a ROC?</strong><br />
    A ROC is a key point of contact within each office to distribute important legislative and legal  updates to every real estate office. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>What are the benefits of the ROC program? </strong>
    <ul class="checkmark blue">
      <li>A ROC receives &quot;Legislative Briefings&quot; that keep your agents updated on the rapidly  changing regulatory environment.</li>
      <li>REALTORS&reg; become aware of legislation that affects their bottom line. </li>
      <li>When REALTORS&reg; use the information SDAR gives them, elected officials better  understand the impact that legislation has on your bottom line.</li>
      <li>The ROC program unifies and magnifies the REALTOR&reg; voice.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="content-box two"><strong>As the manager of an office, how do you start the ROC program?<br />
