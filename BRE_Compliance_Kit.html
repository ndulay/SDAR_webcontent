  <h4><strong>Brokers - Avoid additional fees and reduce your legal risk</strong></h4>
  <p>The California Association of REALTORS&reg; (C.A.R.) has notified SDAR that there are licensees under brokerages that are not listed as REALTOR&reg; members with SDAR, or do not show as active REALTORS&reg; in NAR&rsquo;s database.</p>
  <p> If you have been identified by C.A.R. as having licensees listed under your brokerage, SDAR will send you an email that will list the agents that will need to have their membership status addressed. &nbsp;Perhaps they are members of another association, no longer under your brokerage, or referral-only agents. For additional information, please review the CalBRE Compliance Kit listed below. Be sure to check your email and respond accordingly. </p>
  <p class="redbold">(If you have already submitted your information to SDAR within the last 30 days, please disregard this notice as C.A.R. is in the process of updating their records.)</p>
  <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If licensees are no longer affiliated with your office and CalBRE records indicate you as the employing broker, you are and will be held liable for any real estate transaction they undertake. Please click the links below to find the forms required to identify their REALTOR&reg; membership with another association, terminate their affiliation under your brokerage, or for them to join SDAR as a REALTOR&reg; member.</p>
