<p>The RMS Program is a cutting-edge certification, created by local real estate and legal experts, to help REALTORS&reg; enhance their industry knowledge, execute better transactions and reduce their exposure to risk. The foundation of the RMS certification is the completion of courses that focus on risk mitigation. <strong>All courses are CalBRE-approved and accredited</strong> and will be offered through Risk Management. Membership in the RMS Program includes many benefits, such as a 10% discount on selected SDAR classes and seminars, as well as on the purchase of transaction forms for RMS in paper format from SDAR's REALTOR&reg; Stores.</p>
