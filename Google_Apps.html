We use smart technology to route your calls. So, if you're already on a Google Voice call, we'll recognize it and use call waiting to reach you on the phone you're on.<a href="http://www.sdar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=298&amp;Itemid=486"><img style="float: right; padding-right:5px; padding-top:10px;" src="images/button_sign.png" alt="event" height="15" width="98" /></a></p>
