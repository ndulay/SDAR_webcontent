  <h3><strong>Veterans</strong></h3>
  <p>    San Diego is home to the third-largest veteran population in the United States. San Diego is also known as America's Finest City, and SDAR's leadership wants that to be the case for our veterans and active-duty services members living here.<br />
    <br />
SDAR works hard to ease struggles for veterans, active-duty military members and their families. We do this in myriad ways, particularly through our <a href="http://ambassadorsfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Ambassadors Foundation</a> and such programs as first-time home buyer's workshops and VA loan education.</p>
