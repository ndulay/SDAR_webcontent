<p>{mooblock=Listing Boards }</p>
<div class="accord-inner">
<p>SDAR members can now promote property listings at SDAR Service Centers. SDAR understands the competitive real estate environment and wants to help members expand their marketing reach (for FREE). Here's how to participate:</p>
<p>Email <a href="mailto:listingboard@sdar.com?subject=SDAR%20Listing%20Board" target="_blank"></a><a href="mailto:listingboard@sdar.com">listingboard@sdar.com</a> and provide the following:</p>
<ul class="checkmark red">
<li>A print-ready PDF of your 8.5 x 11, single-sheet listing flyer* (files cannot exceed 10 MB).</li>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>SDAR member #</li>
<li>The property MLS # and expiration date</li>
</ul>
<p>Once SDAR receives your email request, you will be contacted by a Member Services Representative who will confirm receipt of your materials. While it's free to advertise your listing, a nominal $5 printing fee will apply to cover print costs for producing 40 flyers. REALTOR® Plus + members will receive a 15% discount off this printing fee.</p>
<p>Payments can be made by credit card and will be processed when a SDAR Member Services Representative contacts you to confirm receipt of your materials. You're welcome to deliver 40 flyers to SDAR's Kearny Mesa Service Center to avoid this fee.</p>
<p>Listing board advertising requests will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Requests submitted by the 25th of each month will be scheduled for promotion during the following month (based on availability). At the close of the promotional period, remaining flyers will be removed. As a courtesy to your fellow SDAR members, please notify SDAR if your property has sold.</p>
<p>Space is limited so secure your spot now!</p>
<p class="diclaim">*Listing flyer content must adhere to Sandicor® MLS rules and regulations.</p>
