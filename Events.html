<p>You are a part of the community you serve.&nbsp; And so are we. That's why we make it our mission to encourage our members to take an active role in seasonal initiatives to people in need. Or to attend Annual Dinners that not only celebrate our industry but strengthen our bonds of friendship.</p>
<p>Networking is also a top priority, allowing members to interact with new opportunities. Seek out knowledgeable advice. Or just receive some well deserved encouragement.</p>
<p>In fact, we're involved in over 50 events a year…from educational seminars and conferences to social gatherings and casual get-togethers. Each with ample opportunity for you, or your company, to participate in active sponsorship.</p>
<p>Connect …Contribute…Be Involved!</p>
