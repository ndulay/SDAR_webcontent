    <p>Since 1913, REALTORS&reg; have subscribed to a strict Code of Ethics. Although the real estate industry itself has evolved over the past century, the core values and commitment to excellence have remained constant. The Code of Ethics was seen as a declaration of the real estate industry’s principles and beliefs, a “golden thread” uniting those devoted to raising the standards of professionalism and service in real estate.   </p>
    <p>REALTORS&reg; bring a wealth of resources to consumers so that they can give their clients the best possible representation during the transaction process. The Code of Ethics identifies professional responsibilities owed to clients, customers, other REALTORS&reg; and the general public.</p>
