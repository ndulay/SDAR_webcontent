<p>SDAR creates many networking opportunities to learn, network with colleagues, and give back to the San Diego community. No matter what your specialty, age group, or interest is, we have a networking group for you!</p>
<p>{mooblock=Broker Circles}</p>
<div class="accord-inner">
<p>SDAR understands the unique needs of brokers so we have created a venue for brokers in the San Diego area to gather and exchange best business practices, ideas, information and knowledge. This venue also allows for brokers to learn about new and upcoming laws that may affect the way they do business. The Broker Circles are held once each month at one of SDAR's service centers. To register, please fill out the form completely.</p>
