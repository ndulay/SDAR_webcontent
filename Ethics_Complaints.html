<p>The Code of Ethics distinguishes REALTORS&reg; from other real estate professionals. All REALTORS&reg; are required to take an Ethics Class every four years to help the standard that they are required to practice. <a href="http://www.realtor.org/MemPolWeb.nsf/pages/COde" target="_blank">More</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Filing Ethics Complaints</h3>
<p>The local board or association of REALTORS&reg; can provide you with information on the procedures for filing an ethics complaint. Here are some general principles to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Ethics complaints must be filed with the local board or association of REALTORS&reg; within one hundred eighty (180) days from the time a complainant knew (or reasonably should have known) that potentially unethical conduct took place.</p>
<p>The REALTORS&reg; Code of Ethics consists of seventeen (17) Articles. The duties imposed by many of the Articles are explained and illustrated through accompanying Standards of Practice or case interpretations.</p>
<p>Your complaint should include a narrative description of the circumstances that lead you to believe the Code of Ethics may have been violated.</p>
<p>Your complaint must cite one or more of the Articles of the Code of Ethics which may have been violated. Hearing panels decide whether the Articles expressly cited in complaints were violated - not whether Standards of Practice or case interpretations were violated.</p>
<p>The local board or association of REALTORS&reg; Grievance Committee may provide technical assistance in preparing a complaint in proper form and with proper content. <a href="http://www.realtor.org/code-of-ethics/ethics-complaints-arbitration-requests-and-related-information" target="_blank">MORE on Ethics Complaints</a></p>
