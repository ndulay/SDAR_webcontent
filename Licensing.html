Online access is immediate; mailed items ship the business day after the order is placed and arrive within 5-7 business days. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Study your materials.</strong> The state-mandated minimum study time is 18 days per course. The maximum study time is one year from the date of your order. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>3. (Optional) Take the quizzes.</strong> Optional quizzes are provided with all First Tuesday licensing courses. Answers are provided to help you measure your understanding of the material. <br />
    <br />

  <h3>Our Courses</h3>
  <p>All the lessons in the course are completed online. Each hour of approved credit will take approximately one hour of computer time to complete.
