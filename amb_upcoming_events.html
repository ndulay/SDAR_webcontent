  8th Annual </strong><strong>Charity Golf Tournament</strong></h3>
<p><strong>
  Friday, October 24, 2014</strong><strong><br />
    <br />
    Admiral Baker Golf Course</strong>
</p>
<p>Join us for our Annual Golf Tournament benefitting the Ambassadors Foundation.  This year our emphasis is on FUN!  We will be playing in a light hearted 4-person scramble.  This format allows all players to play from the best shot on their team.  Giving avid golfers the chance to shine, while newer players enjoy a faster and less challenging round of golf.  Take advantage of this opportunity to bond with your teammates in an entertaining and exciting atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Register: Coming soon...</strong></p>
