<p style="margin-top: 10px;">Affiliate members are individuals or companies who, while not directly engaged as real estate agents or brokers, have business interests or are a part of real estate transactions and also support the objectives of SDAR. They include, but are not limited to Home Mortgage Divisions, Financial Services, Escrow, Title Home Inspection, Insurance, Appraiser, and Home Staging companies. SDAR offers an industry-related Affiliate Membership that provides you access to our "Association Members Only" events, educational classes, and seminars.</p>
<p><strong>As an Affiliate member you will be partnering with the largest, and oldest, association in San Diego.</strong> With over 130 years experience as a trade association, SDAR has refined most of the peaks and valleys of the local real estate market.</p>
